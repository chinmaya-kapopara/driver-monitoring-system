# Road Safety - Driver Monitoring System

The advancement in the medical field has reduced the mortality rate tremendously. But, one of the major reasons for death is accidents, which any medical progress cannot solve. Also, it is believed that the majority of accidents are either due to drowsiness or distraction of the driver. So, building a system to overcome this problem becomes very crucial. Currently, there exist very few accurate systems focusing on solving the problem. So, I have tried to build a system to make the driver alert at the proper time if the driver is drowsy or distracted, which will prevent an accident. The project can be divided into five parts: face detection, face recognition, face landmark detection, drowsiness detection, and distraction detection.

Libraries Used:

dlib
cv2
face_recognition
pickle
imutils
math
time
numpy
pyttsx3
playsound
scipy.spatial
threading
